# 1

 1) The question we are trying to answer is weather there's an association between the quantity of FAIR policies and the racial composition of a zip code after adjusting for confounding variables. This ultimately may shine light on weather there was redlining in this zip code or not.
 
 2) I used a multiple linear regression model to answer this question. This tool allows us to see relationships between variables while adjusting for confounders.
 
 3)
```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
library(effectsize)
redlining <- read.csv("redlining.csv")

lm = lm(policies ~ minority + fire + age + income, data=redlining)

get_regression_table(lm, conf.level = 0.95, digits=2)
```
  The table shows the effect of variables on number of policies while keeping other variables constant.


4) When adjusted for the confounding variables of fire, age, and income, the estimated effect of minorities on number of policies is .01, which is positive meaning a increased effect. The p value is of this estimate is .01 meaning the estimate is statistically significant therefore showing that minority is a factor on number of policies.

```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
grocery <- read.csv("groceries.csv")

```

### A 

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
store <- grocery %>%
  group_by(Store)%>%
  summarize(avg = mean(Price))

ggplot(store, aes(x = Store, y = avg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Average Price of Products by Store",
       x = "Store",
       y = "Average Price") +
  coord_flip()
```

This distribution shows the average price of products by store. The store with the highest average price is Whole Foods while the store with the lowest is Fiesta.

### B 

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
product1 <- grocery %>%
  group_by(Product)%>%
  summarize(num = n_distinct(Store))

ggplot(product1, aes(x = num, y = Product)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Stores Selling Each Product",
       x = "Number of Stores",
       y = "Product")
```

This graph represents the number of stores that sell each product. Milk and Eggs have the highest number of stores selling their products. Some of the products with the least number of stores selling them is the 1 pound bag of Frosted Flakes, the El Milagros Tortilla Chips, and the one pound bag of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

### C
```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

model = lm(Price ~ Product + Type, data=grocery)

coef <- round(coef(model), 2)
interval <- round(confint(model),2)

```

Compared with ordinary grocery stores (like Albertsons, HEB, or Krogers), convenience stores charge somewhere between .41 and .92 dollars more for the same product.” 

### D

```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
model2 = lm(Price ~ Product + Store, data=grocery)
coefficients_df <- coef(model2)
coefficients_df <- data.frame(term = names(coefficients_df), estimate = as.numeric(coefficients_df))

sorted_coefficients <- coefficients_df[order(coefficients_df$estimate, decreasing = TRUE), ]

```

The two stores that seem to have the highest price when comparing the same products is Whole Foods and Wheatsville Food Co-OP The two stores that seem to have the lowest price when comparing same products is Walmart and Kroger Fresh Fare. 

### E

As central Market's estimated affect is -0.57 and HEB's estimated effect is -0.64, Central market charges about 0.07 more than HEB when comparing the same products. I would say this is not as bad of a difference as other stores. For example Walgreen's is .21 and and Kroger is -.7. I'd conclude they charge similar amounts. 

### F

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

data <- grocery %>% 
  mutate(Income10K = Income / 10000)

model3 <- lm(Price ~ Product + Income10K, data=data)
model3_coef <- coef(model3)

stand <- standardize_parameters(model3)
```

Since the estimate for Income10K is negative -0.014, this means that as income increases, price decreases. This means that people in poorer zip codes pay more for the same products.
A one-standard deviation increase in the income of a ZIP code seems to be associated with a -0.03 standard-deviation change in the price that consumers in that ZIP code expect to pay for the same product.
